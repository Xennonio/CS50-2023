Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the order of chances of winning vary too much.
But if you increase it too much the winners are usually Germany and England,
while the United States should be first

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
